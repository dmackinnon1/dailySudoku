# dailySudoku
A repository for a generated sudoku puzzle. Although the puzzle is not generated every day, when it is generated it is "Today's Sudoku." :)

The puzzle is generated using a script in the [dmackinnon1/sudoku](https://github/dmacmkinnon1/sudoku) repo. The script in **dmackinnon1/sudoku** will generate a .tex document
that uses the *sudoku* LaTeX package for formatting. 

The **dailySudoku** repository is synchronized with an Overleaf project of the same name. The generated .tex document can be given further formatting in Overleaf.

See https://dmackinnon1.github.io/sudoku/ for interactive sudoku puzzles.
